npm run test:e2e:headed
```

### Test Configuration

The tests are configured to:
- Run against `http://localhost:3000`
- Use 30-second timeouts for AI responses
- Retry failed tests twice
- Generate HTML and JSON reports
- Run sequentially for better debugging

## üöÄ Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
1. Development server running: `npm run dev`
2. All dependencies installed: `npm install`
3. LangChain integration working properly

### Quick Start
```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, run the tests
npm run test:chat
```

### Test Results
- HTML Report: `test-results/chat-tests/index.html`
- JSON Results: `test-results/chat-tests/results.json`
- Screenshots: `test-results/chat-tests/` (on failures)

## üîß Test Scenarios

### 1. Personality Validation

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Tests Failing Due to Server Not Running
```bash
# Make sure development server is running
npm run dev
# Then run tests in another terminal
npm run test:chat
```

#### 2. LangChain Integration Errors
- Check that Google Generative AI API key is configured
- Verify LangChain dependencies are installed
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

#### 3. Test Timeouts
- Increase timeout in test configuration if needed
- Check network connectivity
- Verify AI service response times

#### 4. Personality Not Showing
- Check that LangChain service is properly initialized
- Verify system prompt is being used
- Check conversation memory is working

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run tests in debug mode
npm run test:e2e:debug

# Run with UI for step-by-step debugging
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

## üìä Performance Considerations

### Response Times
- LangChain responses: 2-5 seconds typical
- Recipe generation: 10-30 seconds
- Test timeouts: 30 seconds configured

### Memory Usage
- Conversation memory: Limited to recent context
- BufferMemory: Automatically manages memory size
- New chat sessions: Clear memory for fresh start

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **Advanced Memory Management**: Implement conversation summarization
2. **Personality Customization**: Allow users to adjust ChefGPT's personality
3. **Multi-language Support**: Extend personality to other languages
4. **Voice Integration**: Add voice-based conversation testing
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Track conversation quality metrics

### Testing Enhancements
1. **Performance Testing**: Measure response times and memory usage
2. **Load Testing**: Test with multiple concurrent conversations
3. **Accessibility Testing**: Ensure personality works with screen readers
4. **Mobile Testing**: Test personality on mobile devices

## üìù Contributing

When adding new personality features or conversation flows:

1. **Add Tests First**: Write tests for new functionality
2. **Update Documentation**: Document new personality traits
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Run full test suite before committing
4. **Consider Edge Cases**: Test error scenarios and edge cases
5. **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure new features align with ChefGPT personality

## üéØ Success Metrics

The enhanced chat system should achieve:
- **Personality Consistency**: 95%+ of responses show appropriate personality
- **Context Retention**: 90%+ of follow-up questions reference previous context
- **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on conversation quality
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of 99%+ of error scenarios
- **Response Quality**: Educational and helpful responses 95%+ of the time
